- Do I build a database for responses? Or is that to extensive?

- Create a structure for the user to go through to talk with the bot?
- Will it be within the terminal? Or will there be a GUI(Graphical User Interface) involved?
- Make a start of what you think, and then go from there.

- Key:Value-Pair ChatBot created. Very basic. Cannot output detailed responses.
- Then from there, make it more complex.  Either integrating libraries, or incorporate an API.
